Here are links to some python packages I have either contributed to or written:

* [Fokker-Planck: Python module for parameter inference, calculation of spectrum, and numerical simulation of the Fokker-Planck equation](https://github.com/juliankappler/fokker-planck)
* [Fractional-wave-equation: Python module for the numerical solution of nonlinear fractional wave equations](https://github.com/juliankappler/fractional-wave-equation)
* [PyRoss: inference, forecasts, and optimised control for epidemiological models in Python](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/)
