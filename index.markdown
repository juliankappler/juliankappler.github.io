Hello! My name is Julian. I am currently a postdoc at the [Department of
Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP)](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk)
at [Cambridge University](https://www.cam.ac.uk).
Before, I did my PhD at the [Physics Department](https://www.physik.fu-berlin.de)
at [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de).

My current research is mainly focused on stochastic processes.
