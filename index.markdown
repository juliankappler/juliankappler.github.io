Hello! My name is Julian. I am currently a postdoc at the
[Faculty of Physics](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/index.html)
at [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München](https://www.lmu.de/en/), where I work in the
group of [Erwin Frey](https://www.theorie.physik.uni-muenchen.de/lsfrey/group_frey/index.html).
Before that, I was a postdoc at the
[Department of
Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP)](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk)
at [Cambridge University](https://www.cam.ac.uk), where I worked mainly with
[Ronojoy Adhikari](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/person/ra413)
in the [Soft Matter Research Group](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/softmatter/index).
Before that, I did my PhD in the group of [Roland Netz](https://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/einrichtungen/ag/ag-netz/index.html)
at the [Physics Department](https://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html)
at [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/).

My current research is focused on stochastic processes. In particular, I am currently interested in relating fundamental theoretical concepts to measurement, and in parametrizing stochastic models from data.
