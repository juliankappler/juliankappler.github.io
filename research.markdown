### Path probabilities for diffusive stochastic dynamics

Any kind of diffusive dynamics is fully characterized by its path
probabilities. The probability to observe a given individual trajectory
is zero, so that one would not expect to ever observe a given trajectory
in a experiment.

Technically speaking, the probability to observe a given individual
stochastic trajectory vanishes, much like the probability of a given
number is zero for many continuous probability distributions such as
e.g. the Gaussian distribution. To connect the discussion of path
probabilities to measurement, we consider the tubular ensemble,
comprised of all stochastic trajectories that remain within a tubular
neighborhood of a given reference path. While in the limit of vanishing
tube radius only the reference path remains in the tubular ensemble, for
finite tube radius the probability to observe any of the trajectories of
the tubular ensemble is positive. The tubular ensemble for
small-but-finite radius is hence an experimentally accessible surrogate
for probing any question that can be asked about paths for diffusive
stochastic dynamics.

### Waves at interfaces

Everybody is familiar with capillary-gravity surface waves, which can
for example be excited by throwing a stone in water. A second kind of
surface wave can exist if the surface has an elastic response, which is
for example the case if a fluid is covered by a biomembrane. This wave
is basically a 2D sound wave which propagates along the elastic
interface, but because of the coupling to the underlying fluid its
properties are very different from the usual sound waves in 3D. We
showed that this 2D sound wave obeys a fractional wave equation, and
found an intuitive explanation for the appearance of the fractional
derivative in this context.
